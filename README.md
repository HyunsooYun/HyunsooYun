### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University studying transportation engineering.
 My current research interest lies in 
- Intelligent transportation systems 
- Traffic assignment 
- Reinforcement learning

I'm excited to share that I'll be uploading the works from my published papers soon. 
Additionally, I plan to upload the works as soon as the papers have been accepted. Stay tuned for more updates!

Feel free to drop me an email if you wish to discuss any of the topics or any other subjects that may be of interest.
